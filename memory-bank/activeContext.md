# Active Context: ImpressoX Development

### 2025-05-17

**Market Monitor & X-Scraper Integration**
- Added market monitoring system with rule-based price tracking
- Implemented X-scraper worker for social data collection
- Components work together with Redis for rule storage and MongoDB for data persistence
- Next steps: Enhance rule matching, optimize notification flow

### 2025-05-08

- Updated system architecture: added backend service layer (handles business logic, data retrieval, external system integration, separate from API layer).
- Updated entire memory bank (projectbrief.md, productContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md) to reflect the role and position of the backend in the system.
- Next steps: standardize communication between API and backend, add architectural documentation/diagrams, review worker/service backend integration.

### 2025-05-06

- Added `summary_social` tool for GENERAL_NODE, allowing summarization of information on X/Twitter or similar queries.
- Tool uses API configured in `configs/api.yaml` (`summary_social.url`) and calls via `call_api` function.
- Registered tool via decorator `@register_tool(NodeName.GENERAL_NODE, "summary_social")`.
- Updated API configuration, created tool file, and registered tool into the system.

## Current Focus

### Market Monitoring System
- Rule-based price tracking and alerts
- Integration with X-scraper for social signals
- Redis-based rule storage
- MongoDB for data persistence
- Notification dispatch system

### Backend Service Layer
- Modular service architecture
- Data access and business logic separation
- External system integration
- Worker coordination

### Worker Infrastructure
- Market monitor worker
- X-scraper worker
- Notify worker
- RAG processor

## Recent Learnings

1. Market Monitor Pattern
