# Progress: ImpressoX Agent

## What Works

### Core Infrastructure
- Project memory bank initialized and regularly updated
- System architecture includes a backend service layer (handles business logic, data retrieval, external system integration, separate from the API layer)
- Agent orchestrator, node structure, tool registry implemented
- Core prompts for swap, alert, trend/news, and portfolio are in place
- Tool registration system and execution pipeline operational

### Market Monitor & Social Data
- Market monitoring system with rule-based price tracking
- X-scraper worker for social media data collection
- Redis-based rule storage system
- MongoDB integration for data persistence
- Notification dispatch system

### Tools & Integrations
- `summary_social` tool for X/Twitter content summarization
- Price tracking and market watching tools
- Redis checkpointing and caching
- ELK stack for logging

## What's Left to Build

### Backend & Integration
- Develop backend service layer to execute business logic, standardize API-backend communication, integrate workers, automation, and external systems
- Enhance rule matching and notification optimization
- Implement cross-service monitoring
- Add more price data sources

### Core Features
- Real logic for cross-chain swap execution
- Portfolio management implementation
- Wallet anomaly detection and alerting
- AI-powered news analysis system
- Security guardrails and transaction validation

### Blockchain Integration
- Smart contract deployment and testing
- Espresso Network integration
- Cross-chain transaction handling
- Wallet security implementation

### Client Interfaces
- Web application development
- Telegram bot enhancement
- Discord bot implementation
- Multi-platform session management

### Automation & Monitoring
- Scheduled task system
- Event-driven workflows
- System-wide monitoring
- Performance optimization

## Current Status (May 2025)

### Implemented
- Market monitoring infrastructure
- Social data collection system
- Backend service layer architecture
- Core tool registration and execution
- Basic notification system

### In Progress
- Rule matching enhancements
- API-backend standardization
- Worker integration review
- Service interface documentation

### Pending
- Real blockchain integration
- Production security measures
- Client interface development
- Automation system implementation

## Known Issues

- Rule matching needs optimization
- Notification system requires rate limiting
- Worker coordination needs improvement
- Documentation requires updates for new features

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Recent Changes
- Documentation-first approach and memory bank updates synchronized with architectural changes
- Added market monitoring and social data collection
- Implemented modular backend service layer
- Enhanced worker infrastructure

### Next Phase Focus
- Backend service implementation
- Real integrations and automation
- Security and monitoring
- Cross-service optimization
- Client interface development
