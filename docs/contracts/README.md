# ImpressoX Smart Contracts Documentation

The `contracts/` directory is designated for the smart contract system of the ImpressoX AI Agent. These contracts will enable on-chain interactions, automated transactions, and integration with DeFi protocols, with a strong focus on leveraging the Espresso Network for fair ordering and privacy.

**Current Status (May 2025):** Smart contract development is a planned phase of the ImpressoX project. Currently, this directory serves as a placeholder for future contract code, tests, and deployment scripts. The information below outlines the envisioned architecture and development approach.

## Envisioned Smart Contract Architecture

The smart contract system will interact with the ImpressoX Backend Service Layer, which will orchestrate calls to the contracts based on agent decisions or user requests.

## Planned Directory Structure

A typical Hardhat-based structure is anticipated:

```
contracts/
├── contracts/          # Solidity smart contract source code (.sol)
│   ├── core/           # Core ImpressoX logic contracts
│   ├── interfaces/     # Interfaces for external contracts and standards (e.g., ERC20, ERC721)
│   ├── libraries/      # Reusable Solidity libraries
│   └── vendor/         # Third-party contracts (e.g., OpenZeppelin)
│
├── test/               # Contract test suite (JavaScript/TypeScript using Hardhat/Ethers.js)
│   ├── unit/
│   └── integration/
│
├── scripts/            # Deployment and interaction scripts
│   ├── deploy.ts       # Main deployment script
│   └── tasks/          # Custom Hardhat tasks
│
├── hardhat.config.ts   # Hardhat configuration file
├── deployments/        # Artifacts of deployed contracts (address, ABI) per network
└── .env.example        # Environment variable template for private keys, RPC URLs
```

## Core Contract Ideas (To Be Developed)

-   **User Wallet Manager**: A contract (or set of contracts) that could act as a smart wallet or interact with users' existing EOA/smart wallets to execute transactions authorized by the ImpressoX agent. This would likely involve meta-transactions or delegated execution.
-   **Swap Router/Aggregator**: Contracts to facilitate cross-chain or single-chain swaps, potentially interacting with existing DEX aggregators or directly with liquidity pools. Emphasis on routing transactions through Espresso Network for fair sequencing.
-   **Alert/Automation Registry**: Contracts where users might register specific on-chain conditions for automated actions or alerts (e.g., "if my collateralization ratio drops below X, notify me or attempt to rebalance").
-   **Access Control Contract**: Manages permissions for the agent or backend services to interact with user-specific contract functionalities.

## Development Approach

### Technologies
-   **Solidity**: For smart contract implementation.
-   **Hardhat**: For development, testing, and deployment.
-   **Ethers.js**: For interacting with contracts from scripts and tests.
-   **OpenZeppelin Contracts**: For secure, standard contract components.
-   **TypeChain**: For generating TypeScript typings for contracts.

### Testing Strategy
-   **Unit Tests**: For individual contract functions and logic.
-   **Integration Tests**: For interactions between multiple contracts.
-   **Forked Mainnet/Testnet Tests**: To test interactions with existing DeFi protocols in a realistic environment.
-   **Coverage**: Aim for high test coverage.

### Deployment
-   Scripts for deploying to various networks (local Hardhat network, testnets, Espresso testnet/mainnet, and target rollups/chains).
-   Verification of contract source code on block explorers.
-   Use of upgradable proxy patterns (e.g., UUPS or Transparent Proxies) for core logic contracts to allow for future enhancements.

## Espresso Network Integration

A key aspect of ImpressoX's smart contract strategy will be deep integration with the **Espresso Network**. This includes:
-   Submitting transactions to the Espresso Sequencer to benefit from fair ordering and pre-confirmation privacy.
-   Designing contracts to be compatible with Espresso's architecture and any specific requirements for rollups utilizing Espresso.
-   Leveraging Espresso's privacy features where applicable to protect user transaction details.

## Security Considerations

Security will be paramount.
-   Adherence to smart contract security best practices (e.g., Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, reentrancy guards).
-   Comprehensive test suites.
-   Use of well-audited libraries like OpenZeppelin.
-   Plans for formal security audits by third-party firms before any mainnet deployment involving significant user funds.
-   Consideration of timelocks for critical administrative functions.
-   Emergency stop mechanisms or pausable contracts for critical situations.

## Monitoring and Maintenance (Future)

-   Off-chain services (potentially workers) will monitor contract events and state.
-   Scripts for administrative tasks (e.g., upgrading proxies, managing parameters).

This documentation will be updated significantly as smart contract development progresses.
