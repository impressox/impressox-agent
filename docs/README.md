# 🧠 ImpressoX – AI Agent for DeFi Wallet Management

**ImpressoX** is your personal AI agent for DeFi, powered by Espresso Network.  
*Automated. Intelligent. Cross-Chain.*

---

## Project Status (May 2025)

> **Note:**  
> The current codebase provides the architectural foundation, agent orchestrator, node structure, tool registry, and detailed AI prompts for DeFi wallet management, swap, alert, trend/news, and portfolio analysis.  
> **However, most DeFi/AI features are at the prompt and design level only. There is not yet real integration with blockchain, external data sources, or the Espresso Network. Security guardrails and automation logic are not implemented.**  
> See the roadmap below for planned development.

ImpressoX unifies and automates DeFi wallet management, providing a single AI agent that acts, alerts, and protects across chains—powered by Espresso Network for privacy, speed, and fair execution.
